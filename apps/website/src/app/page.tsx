          As we tackled more and more projects, our surface area grew organically, not by design. The dominant
          experience became <span className={cn('font-bold text-ink dark:text-dark-paper')}>mental fog</span>: losing
          track of what deploys where, how configuration interacts, how to set up a given environment, and generally,
          where we were mentally when last touching a project. Projects felt half-baked, never brought live properly,
          never documented or guardrailed enough for autopilot.

        <p className={cn('mt-6')}>
          <span className={cn('font-bold text-ink dark:text-dark-paper')}>Plexus is our response. </span>
          It forces us to do things properly, to re-use as much as possible, and to standardize as far as possible, so
          that each new self-hosted project or app adds near-zero overhead. Have a look around{' '}
